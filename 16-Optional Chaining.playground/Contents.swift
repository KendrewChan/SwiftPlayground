// Optional chaining is a process for querying(validating) and calling properties, methods, and subscripts on an optional that might currently be nil
// Multiple queries can be chained together and the entire chain fails gracefuly if any link in the chain is nil

//Example to show how optional chaining differs from forced unwrapping and enables you to check for success
